## Structure
### general information on the data
1. cleaning of the data
2. plots to get familiar with the data
### Decision Tree
1. one-hot encoding
2. run the model
3. performance scores
4. feature importance plot
5. confusion matrix
### Random Rorest
1. run the model
2. performance scores
3. feature importance plot
4. confusion matrix
### SVM for Multiclass
1. KBest feature selection
2. hyperparameter tuning
3. 5-fold cross validation
4. performance scores
5. feature importance
### Logistic Regression
1. one-hot encoding (only do this if you want to use the one-hot encoding approach)
3. numerical features only (used for the numerical features only approach)
4. binary encoding for binary objects (deactivate this part if you go for one-hot encoding)
5. KBest feature selection
6. run the model (1-fold)
7. performance scores
8. confusion matrix
9. feature importance
10. 5-fold cross validation
11. performance scores
### SVM for Binary
1. KBest feature selection
2. hyperparameter tuning
3. 5-fold cross validation
4. performance scores
5. feature importance
### Binary Decision Tree
1. run the model
2. performance scores
3. feature improtance
4. confusion matrix
### Binary Random Forest
1. run the model
